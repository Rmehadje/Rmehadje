  - Optimized method used for the a very low amount of moves (under 700 moves for 100 numbers, under 5500 moves for 500 numbers)
  - Easy to install and run.
  - two different methods used (5 integers and under/over 5 integers)

#### 💻 [Inception](https://github.com/Rmehadje/Inception.git)
- **Description**: Inception is a system administration project from 42 that involves creating and managing a set of Docker containers for a multi-service infrastructure.
